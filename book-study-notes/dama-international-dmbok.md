"Responsability for managing data must be shared between business and information technology roles, and people in both areas must be able to collaborate to ensure an organization has high quality data that meets its strategic needs." - pg. 1

"Information and knowledge hold the key to competitive advantage. Organizations that have reliable, high quality data about their costumers, products, services, and operations can make better decisions than those without data or with unreliable data. Failure to manage data is similar to failure to manage capital." - pg. 2

"In relation to information technology, data is also understood as information that has been stored in digital form [...]. Still, because today we can capture so much information electronically, we call many things 'data' that would not have been called 'data' in earlier times [...]." - pg. 2
</p>

"This is another way of saying that we need context for data to be meaningful. Context can be thought of as data's representational system [...]. These conventions are often documented in a specific kind of data referred to as Metadata." - pg. 3
</p>

<p align="justify">
"Even within a single organization, there are often multiple ways of representing the same idea. Hence the need for data architecture, modeling, governance, and stewardship, and metadata and data quality management, all which help people understand and use data. Across organizations, the problem of multiplicity multiplies. Hence the need for industy-level data standards that can bring more consistency to data." - pg. 3
